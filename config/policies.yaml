# Agent Harness Governance Policy Configuration
# =============================================
# This file defines governance parameters that control kernel behavior.
# Policies are loaded at kernel initialization and remain static.
# No hot reload - changes require restart.

# Governance limits and thresholds
limits:
  # Maximum steps before forced halt
  max_steps: 100
  
  # Maximum effort budget (1.0 = full capacity)
  max_effort: 1.0
  
  # Maximum risk threshold before halt
  max_risk: 0.8
  
  # Maximum exploration threshold before halt
  max_exploration: 0.9
  
  # Minimum effort before exhaustion halt
  exhaustion_threshold: 0.05

# Stagnation detection parameters
stagnation:
  # Number of zero-progress steps before stagnation detected
  window: 10
  
  # Effort floor during stagnation
  effort_floor: 0.1
  
  # Effort scaling during stagnation (0-1)
  effort_scale: 0.7
  
  # Persistence scaling during stagnation (0-1)
  persistence_scale: 0.6
  
  # Minimum progress to count as non-stagnating
  progress_threshold: 0.05

# Recovery parameters
recovery:
  # Recovery rate per time unit
  rate: 0.25
  
  # Maximum recovery cap
  cap: 1.0
  
  # Delay before recovery begins
  delay: 0.5

# Decay parameters
decay:
  # Persistence decay per step
  persistence: 0.05
  
  # Exploration decay per step
  exploration: 0.05
  
  # Time-based persistence decay
  time_persistence: 0.002
  
  # Time-based exploration decay
  time_exploration: 0.002

# Scaling factors for budget computation
scaling:
  effort: 1.0
  risk: 1.0
  exploration: 1.0
  persistence: 1.0
